# Kick YOOtheme Plugin Demo

This repository contains the **Kick YOOtheme Plugin Demo**, which was created for the **YOOtheme Community Day 2025**.  
It was presented in the talk **“Beyond Child Themes”** by [Niels Nübel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nielsnuebel/).

The plugin demonstrates how to extend **YOOtheme Pro** in Joomla with custom modules and features – going beyond simple child themes.
